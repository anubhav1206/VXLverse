   - To move the object, click and drag it to the desired position within the grid.
   - To rotate the object, click on the "Rotate" tool and drag the rotation handles.
   - To scale the object, click on the "Scale" tool and drag the scaling handles.

3. [ ] To add a material to your object, click on the "Materials" tab in the sidebar and choose a material from the list. Then, click on the object to apply the material.

4. [ ] You can continue adding objects and materials to build your 3D scene.

5. [ ] To save your work, click on the "Export" button to download the scene as a JSON file. You can also import a previously saved JSON file by clicking the "Import" button and selecting the file from your computer.

6. [ ] If you need to delete an object, click on the object and press the "Delete" button in the sidebar.

Remember toexperiment with different objects, materials, and transformations to create unique and immersive 3D scenes. The intuitive interface and powerful features of Web3DWorldBuilder make it easy for users of all skill levels to design and share their creations.
